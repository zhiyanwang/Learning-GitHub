1. Create Repository: On GitHub directly.

https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/:

2. Type: "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY" Link to computer: Clone/Download, copy the HTTP link, open terminal and cd to the work directory on computer.

3. Type "git remote -v" and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.

4. Type "git remote add upstream", and then paste the URL you copied from original repository and press Enter. It will look like this: git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git

5. Type "git fetch upstream": Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master.

6. Type "git checkout master": Check out your fork's local master branch.

7. Type "git merge upstream/master": Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.

8. When I already have the code on my computer, to create a new repo: New repo -> clone -> git add
